## Doubly Linked Lists

## Description
Doubly linked lists contains nodes which holds
the address of next and previous node. The head
node has a previous adddress which points to
NULL and the last node has a next address which
points to NULL. Doubly linked list can be traversed
both forwards and backwards. The disadvantage of a
doubly linked list is that it takes up more memory space
compared to a singly linked list

## Doubly Linked List

# Description
A doubly linked list has nodes which contains the address of the
next and previous nodes. The head node has NULL in its previous address
while the last node has NULL in its next address. The advantage of a
doubly linked list is that it can be traversed both forwards and
backwards.The disadvantage is that it takes up more memory compared
to a singly linked list
